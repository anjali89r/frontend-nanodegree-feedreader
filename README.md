# Project Overview

This project given IS a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
This project tests the ability to use a JS framework for testing, like Jasmine, to validate the code.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## Running the app
